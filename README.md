Hop is a browser extension that stores links to your favorite sites in a more visually pleasing way than traditional bookmarks. Hop will try to find an icon for each link automatically, but you can use your own image if you prefer.

It's available for use on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hop/djdlkcbfbdebfaoakhnoienanaakgccd) and as a [Firefox Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hop/).
