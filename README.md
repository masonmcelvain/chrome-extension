# Hop

Hop is a Chrome extension that stores links to your favorite sites in a more visually pleasing way than traditional browser bookmarks. Hop will try to find an icon for each link automatically, but you can use your own image if you prefer.

It's available for use on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hop/djdlkcbfbdebfaoakhnoienanaakgccd).
